## How to start dev server:
#### Server:
```bash
cd source/server
npm run develop
```

#### Client:
```bash
cd source/client
npm run dev
```

Note: After running the server, you should change the public user's permissions to grant them access to categories and posts in the admin panel.

## TODO:
- Implement E2E test with Cypress
- Dockerize server
- Configure the docker compose
